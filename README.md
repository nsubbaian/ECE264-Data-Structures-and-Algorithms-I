## Assignment 1:
Brief Overview of Assignment (more information in folder): \
You are going to write a program that manipulates stacks and queues. The program should ask the user for the name of an input text file and an output text file. The input file will contain a list of commands, one per line. Each command will direct the program to create a stack or a queue, to push a value onto a stack or a queue, or to pop a value from a stack or a queue. (Most modern sources use the terms "enqueue" or "dequeue" to indicate insertions into and deletions from queues, but we will use "push" and "pop" for both stacks and queues.)

## Assignment 2:
Brief Overview of Assignment (more information in folder): \
You are going to complete a program that sorts the nodes of a linked list. The program will load data from an input file specified by the user and create a linked list of pointers to data objects using the provided C++ list class. Each data object will consist of four fields. The first two fields will be unsigned 32-bit integers (but these two fields will be generated in different manners, as described later). The third field will be a single printable, standard ASCII character. The fourth field will be a C++ string consisting of exactly 25 printable, standard ASCII characters.
