## Assignment 1:
This main file uses a base class called SimpleList to implement a singly linked
list with the functions of inserting a node at the start of the list, inserting
a node at the end of the list and removing a node from the start of the list.
This base class, along with other included features, as well as a function to
read from a file and three other functions to parse the information from the file,
allow the program to create, push and pop onto a stack or queue based on the
instruction, and output the result into a text file, based on the guidelines
provided in the DSA Programming Assignment #1 Document (in folder above).
